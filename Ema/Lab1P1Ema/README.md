## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

<!--
Lab assignment

Write a Java program that computes the sum of all the integer numbers given as command-line
parameters.

Home assignment
-->

Provide solutions for the following problems:
Write a Java program that prints the prime numbers among the integers numbers given
as command-line parameters.
  
Write a Java program that prints the maximum value from all the double numbers given
as command-line parameters.
  
Write a Java program that prints the greatest common divisor of all integer numbers
given as command-line parameters.

Choose one of the problems below and provide a layered architecture solution (in Java). Requirements necessary for the next lab:
Create the classes necessary for just one entity in the problem requirement (the first mentioned entity).
The layers should be: domain, repository, service, UI. Use Java packages.
Add at least 5 entities in your memory repository (from source code).
All entities should be identifiable (use a generic superclass/interface Identifiable) and unique.
The UI must allow CRUD operations for the used entity.

Design and implement a Java solution for managing the appointments to a dentist. The program should allow CRUD operations for patients, adding a new appointment, cancelling an appointment, creating different reports, etc.
Design and implement a Java solution for managing the orders for birthday-cakes from a cake-shop. The program should allow CRUD operations for birthday-cakes, adding a new order, cancelling an order, finishing an order, creating different reports, etc.
Design and implement a Java solution for managing the reservations for car rentals. The program should allow CRUD operations for cars, creating a reservation (rental), cancelling a reservation, creating different reports, etc.
